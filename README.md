# howler.js

[howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/tree/2.0) is an audio library for the modern web. It defaults to Web Audio API and falls back to HTML5 Audio.

Currently, I'm tracking branch 2.0 beta because

>  the core is fairly stable and is already under heavy production use.


# Usage

`npm install --save react-howler`

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import ReactHowler from 'react-howler'

class App extends Component {
  // This sound file may not work due to cross-origin setting
  render () {
    <ReactHowler
      src='http://goldfirestudios.com/proj/howlerjs/sound.ogg'
      playing={true}
    />
  }
}
```

For a full working example please see it in  [App.js](https://github.com/thangngoc89/react-howler/tree/master/examples/react/App.js)

# Methods

- seek(pos? : Number) Set/get current position of player
- duration: Get duration of current audio file

I only wrapper methods that I need. If you need to use undocumented methods,
you can access howler instance directly via `howler` method

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import ReactHowler from 'react-howler'

class App extends Component {
  getHower () {
    this.audio.howler
  }

  getDuration () {
    this.audio.duration()
  }

  getSeek () {
    this.audio.seek()
  }

  setSeek () {
    this.audio.seek(0.5)
  }
  // This sound file may not work due to cross-origin setting
  render () {
    <ReactHowler
      src='http://goldfirestudios.com/proj/howlerjs/sound.ogg'
      playing={true}
      ref={(ref) => this.audio = ref}
    />
  }
}
```
